# CeobeGame
My first attempt at Unity!

A simple "Look, I can do this!" game that's a sort of... "shoot the targets and defend the left side of the screen" game. 
Will probably not become that complicated, but I will probably add a boss, scoring, and title screen before I'm done.
Unless I get a job first, and lose my free time.
